# 255.se

Website of the 255 Community at Chalmers university of Technology, Sweden.

## Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome. If you don't know how to submit one, send me your proposed updates (text, images, etc.)
and I can add them for you.

Since my graduation from Chalmers and move from Gothenburg I can't engage as actively in the 255 community as I used to.
For the time being I will continue to maintain this website and manage the 255.se domain, but I will have to rely mostly
on contributions from others to keep the website up to date going forwards. If you are a well established member of 255
and interested in taking over ownership of the domain and website you can contact me.
